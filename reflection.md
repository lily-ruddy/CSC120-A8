Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Tell me about your class! What does it represent?
- What additional methods (if any) did you implement alongside those listed in the interface?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

I made a Duck class in which you decided its name and color. Once created, the class will randomly assign its size/weight in pounds. Depending on its size, it'll determine how many energy points it has. Energy points allows the duck to walk, grow, shrink, and grab items. If it doens't have enough energy points it won't do the task. The duck can rest to refill its points. 

For the shrink method, if the duck is already at 1 pound, it can't shrink any smaller. The same happens with grow, a duck can't be larger than 10 pounds. 

The walk method is the most complicated because when given a direction, there is a 1/3 chance that when the duck walks it'll encounter an item. When it encounters the item it has the option of picking it up or not. If the duck chooses yes, it'll apply the grab method to add it to the duck's inventory. 

I'm still working on the gameplay loop, and implementing more of the methods. It's giving me the most trouble. However, I did really like the open nature of this homework because you can really do anything you want.
